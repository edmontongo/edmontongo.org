<h3 id=state-of-go-by-francesc-campoy-flores>State of Go by Francesc Campoy Flores</h3>
<p>Francesc Campoy Flores will talk about the history of Go, the growth of the community, and current state and future of the language we love.</p>
<h3 id=event-sourcing-architectures-and-patterns-by-matt-ho>Event Sourcing Architectures and Patterns by Matt Ho</h3>
<p>Event sourcing and other applications of append-only logs have experienced a renaissance in recent years. From git, to Kafka, to block chains, the use of append-only logs is on the rise.</p>
<p>In this talk, Matt Ho will cover the benefits of event sourcing and how to get started with it using Go. He&rsquo;ll provide the background of event sourcing along with simple illustration of how event-sourcing might be applied to a domain entity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll go in-depth on how event sourcing can address challenges posed by transactional integrity, dual writes, and scaling – issues which are increasing in importance given the rise of REST-based microservices.</p>
<h3 id=rob-pike-on-upspin>Rob Pike on Upspin</h3>
<p>Upspin is an experimental project to build a framework for naming and sharing files and other data securely, uniformly, and globally: a global name system of sorts. It is not a file system, but a set of protocols and reference implementations that can be used to join things like file systems and other storage services to the name space.</p>
<p>Performance is not a primary goal. Uniformity and security are.</p>
<p>Per Rob: Note that this is a project IN Go not ABOUT Go</p>
<h3 id=lessons-learned-from-a-context-nats-integration-by-waldemar-quevedo>Lessons Learned from a Context-NATS Integration by Waldemar Quevedo</h3>
<p>The Context package has been a popular topic in the Go community. It carries a variety of details across API boundaries and between processes.</p>
<p>NATS is an open-source, high-performance, lightweight cloud native messaging system. Many NATS users working in Go have been using Context alongside NATS, but there has not been an officially-supported Context-NATS integration – that is, until now.</p>
<p>This talk will discuss what Context is, what observations and lessons Waldemar and his team have learned integrating Context and NATS, and how you use the two together. He&rsquo;ll also provide a quick demo to show the integration.</p>
