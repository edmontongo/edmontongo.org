[Nathan Youngman](https://github.com/nathany) ([slides](https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/edmontongo/presentations/2018-07/pipes/pipes.slide#1))

Hugo is a static site generator useful for blogs, marketing websites, and so on. We'll take a quick look at [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/), the new asset pipeline, and how it simplifies deployment.

## Workshop

Build and deploy a tiny website with Hugo.

You will need:

- A **laptop** (or make a friend who has one and pair program).
- An **idea** for a small website that you want to build.
- Some familiarity with HTML, CSS, Markdown, and the command line.
- Willingness to learn, ask questions, and lookup documentation.

Try to come prepared:

- Install Hugo Extended from [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/). Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS: `brew install hugo`
- Signup for an account with [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/c0c37ebd590f), or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Expect to learn:

- Why use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/): CSS with superpowers
- Hugo themes with Go templates
- Automating deployments with CircleCI 2.0
- Basic design principles for non-designers
