The Edmonton Go meetup started in 2014, thanks to the support of [Startup Edmonton](https://www.startupedmonton.com).

It has been fun, but interest in organizing these meetups has dwindled, especially in light of the pandemic.

Visit [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pro/go) for other online events for Go.

Or visit [Dev Edmonton Society](https://devedmonton.com) for other meetups in Edmonton.
