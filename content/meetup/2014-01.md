## Talks

## Celsius: Types Are Cool

We will refactor some procedural code, learning how to use types and methods in Go.

_This talk is suitable for programmers new to the Go language._

## Concurrency Is Not Parallelism

[@rob_pike](https://twitter.com/rob_pike) ([video](https://vimeo.com/49718712), [slides](https://talks.golang.org/2012/waza.slide#1), [code](https://github.com/edmontongo/presentations/tree/main/2014-01/robpike))

Concurrency is a way of structuring code that can enable parallel execution. After a number of seemingly silly examples, Rob Pike wraps up with a complete load balancer written in Go.

_The load balancer code will be available to examine, run and discuss after the video. The example is fairly advanced, but the principals can be understood by all._
