## Talks

### Reasons to read The Go Programming Language

[Jordan Torbiak](https://github.com/torbiak) ([slides](https://github.com/torbiak/goplreview/gopl.slide))

The Go Programming Language provides great value as a reference in general and in particular for testing and reflection, as a collection of interesting exercises in a reasonable order, and as a comprehensive textbook after more introductory material like the Tour and Effective Go.
