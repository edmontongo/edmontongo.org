## Talks

_What's new in Hugo_ by [Nathan Youngman](https://github.com/nathany).

Hugo is a static site generator useful for blogs, marketing websites, and so on. We'll take a quick look at [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/), the new asset pipeline, and how it simplifies deployment.

## Workshop

Build and deploy a tiny website with Hugo.

You will need:

* A **laptop** (or make a friend who has one and pair program).
* An **idea** for a small website that you want to build.
* Some familiarity with HTML, CSS, Markdown, and the command line.
* Willingness to learn, ask questions, and lookup documentation.

Try to come prepared:

* Install Hugo Extended from [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/). Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS: `brew install hugo`
* Signup for an [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account.

Expect to learn:

* Why use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/): CSS with superpowers
* Hugo themes with Go templates
* Automating deployments with CircleCI 2.0
* Basic design principles for non-designers
