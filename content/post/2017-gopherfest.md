### State of Go by Francesc Campoy Flores

Francesc Campoy Flores will talk about the history of Go, the growth of the community, and current state and future of the language we love.

### Event Sourcing Architectures and Patterns by Matt Ho

Event sourcing and other applications of append-only logs have experienced a renaissance in recent years. From git, to Kafka, to block chains, the use of append-only logs is on the rise.

In this talk, Matt Ho will cover the benefits of event sourcing and how to get started with it using Go. He'll provide the background of event sourcing along with simple illustration of how event-sourcing might be applied to a domain entity. 

He'll go in-depth on how event sourcing can address challenges posed by transactional integrity, dual writes, and scaling – issues which are increasing in importance given the rise of REST-based microservices.

### Rob Pike on Upspin

Upspin is an experimental project to build a framework for naming and sharing files and other data securely, uniformly, and globally: a global name system of sorts. It is not a file system, but a set of protocols and reference implementations that can be used to join things like file systems and other storage services to the name space.

Performance is not a primary goal. Uniformity and security are. 

Per Rob: Note that this is a project IN Go not ABOUT Go

### Lessons Learned from a Context-NATS Integration by Waldemar Quevedo

The Context package has been a popular topic in the Go community. It carries a variety of details across API boundaries and between processes. 

NATS is an open-source, high-performance, lightweight cloud native messaging system. Many NATS users working in Go have been using Context alongside NATS, but there has not been an officially-supported Context-NATS integration – that is, until now.

This talk will discuss what Context is, what observations and lessons Waldemar and his team have learned integrating Context and NATS, and how you use the two together. He'll also provide a quick demo to show the integration.
