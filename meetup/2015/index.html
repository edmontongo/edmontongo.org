<a href=/meetup/recap/>Two Year Recap</a>
</h2>
<time> November 25 </time>
Two years ago Edmonton Go was just an idea. Thanks to Startup Edmonton for generously providing the space, and to Daniel Huckstep for the requisite kick-in-the-pants, January 27, 2014 marked our first meetup.
Together we&rsquo;ve enjoyed talks, discussions, code reading, hack nights, videos, workshops, cake eating, sphero battles, and other activities. A dozen people delivered 34 talks, sharing their knowledge and experience with everyone. Thank you so much for your contribution!
